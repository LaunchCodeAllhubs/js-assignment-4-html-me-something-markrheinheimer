        <h2 id="mazda626">1990 Mazda 626</h2>
        <p>
          My very first car. I learned how to drive on this and it was a manual.
          It will always have a special place in my heart.

        <h2 id="mazda323">1989 Mazda 323</h2>
        <p>
          My second car. Towards the end of it's life it dropped a cylinder, but
          I still drove it for another year on 3 cylinders.

        <h2 id="mazda626a">1998 Mazda 626</h2>
        <p>
          My love of my first car brought me around to buying another 626. This
          time it was an automatic but I still enjoyed driving it.

        <h2 id="dodgeram">2007 Dodge Ram 1500</h2>
        <p>
          This was my dedicated work vehicle and having second row seats still
          allowed me to take kids with me while the family was still small.

      <article>
        <h2 id="fordexpedition">2007 Ford Expedition black</h2>
        <p>
          My multipurpose work vehicle. Still allows me to manage construction
          projects and with 8 seats it will transport the whole family.

        <h2 id="fordexplorer">2013 Ford Explorer sterling gray metallic</h2>
        <p>
          My wife's car, but occassionally I'll drive it. She really loves it.

        <h2 id="minicooper">2010 Mini Cooper pearl white</h2>
        <p>
          My putting around car. Fun to drive, and a little more reasonable than
          driving a huge vehicle around by yourself.

        <p>
          If a baby number 7 is in the picture, then we won't fit in the
          Expedition and will have to find something bigger. My wife loves the
          Transit vans, but I guess we'll see.
